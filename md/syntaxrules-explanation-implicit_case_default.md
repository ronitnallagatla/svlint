This rule is an extension of the **case_default** rule that allows the case
default to be implicitly defined. Case statements without a `default` branch
can cause signals to be undriven. Setting default values of signals at the top
of an `always` procedures is good practice and ensures that signals are never
metastable when a case match fails. For example,
```sv
always_comb begin
  y = 0;
  case(x)
    1: y = 1;
  endcase
end

```
If the case match fails, `y` wouldn't infer memory or be undriven because the
default value is defined before the `case`.
